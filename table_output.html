      <td>Programming Languages Table Release 8.2, March 1996 By Capers Jones, Chairman, Software  Productivity Research, Inc. Â© Copyright 1997 by Software  Productivity Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. What Is A Language Level? As language levels go up, fewer  statements to code one Function Point are  required. For example, COBOL is a level 3 and requires  about 105 statements per Function Point. The numeric levels of various languages  provide a convenient shortcut for converting size from  one language to another. For example, if an application  requires 1000 non-commentary COBOL statements (level 3),  then it would take only 500 statements in a level 6  language (such as NATURAL) and only 250 statements in a  level 12 language (such as OBJECTIVE C). As you can see,  the average number of statements required is proportional  to the levels of the various languages. Do Language Levels Affect  Productivity? The correlation between the level of a  language and development productivity is not linear. For  most large software projects, coding amounts to only  about 30 percent of the effort. Assume a program is written in a  language that is twice the level of a similar program,  for instance level 6 versus level 3. In this example, the  coding effort might be reduced by 50 percent. But the  total project might be improved by only 15 percent, since  coding only comprised 30 percent of the original effort.  Double the level of the language again to a level 12.  That will only give an additional 7.5 percent net  savings. Once again, coding is halved. But coding is not  a major factor for very high level languages. More accurate economic productivity  rates can be gained by examining the average monthly  Function Point production rates associated with various  language levels. Table 1 looks at how language levels  affect productivity. Table 1. Language Level Relationship  to Productivity LANGUAGE LEVEL PRODUCTIVITY AVERAGE  PER STAFF MONTH -------------- -------------------------  1 - 3 5 to 10 Function Points  4 - 8 10 to 20 Function Points  9 - 15 16 to 23 Function Points  16 - 23 15 to 30 Function Points  24 - 55 30 to 50 Function Points  Above 55 40 to 100 Function Points What Is The Basis For Language Levels? The languages and levels in Table 2  were gathered in four ways. Counting Function Points and  Source Code Counting Source Code Inspecting Source Code Researching Languages Counting Function Points And Source  Code Actual counts of Function Points and  source code statements were performed. Samples of  counting Function Points and source code statements were  done on Ada, several BASIC dialects, COBOL, PASCAL, and  PL/I. Counting Source Code Source code statements were counted,  then compared to the size of the same program in  languages of known levels. Assembly, APL, C, OBJECTIVE C,  FORTH, FORTRAN, LISP, PILOT, and PROLOG are languages  that produce the same source code count as COBOL. So code  sizes were compared to the known quantity of COBOL source  code. Inspecting Source Code Source code inspection for common  applications was done. Then the volume of code for the  application in a measured language was hypothesized.  ACTOR, CLARION, and TRUE BASIC are examples of languages  that were inspected and their levels hypothesized by  subjective means. Researching Languages Research was done by reading  descriptions and genealogies of languages and making an  educated guess as to their levels. KL, CLOS, TWAICE, and  FASBOL are examples of languages that were assigned  tentative levels merely from descriptions of the  language, rather than from actual counts. For spreadsheets the ordinary concepts  of a language do not apply. In this case, formulas,  labels, and constants were considered to be statements. List Of Programming Languages As of 1996, there were more than 500  languages and major dialects of languages available to  software practitioners. Table 2 lists the most common of  them in what is considered version 7 of the SPR  Programming Languages Table. Table 2. Programming Languages and  Levels</td>
